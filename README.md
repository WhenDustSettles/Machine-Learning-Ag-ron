# Machine-Learning-Methods
This Repository contains all the codes and coding question answers when I first started Learning ML from Hands On Machine Learnig with Scikit-Learn And TensorFlow.
**This Repository is only supposed to Cover Topics before Part II of the Book, which covers Deep Learning, for which there were much better material/courses to study from,
One of which is CS231n from Stanford University, The assignments of which should be in some other Repository too.**
